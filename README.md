# DS_algo_study
Study of several algorithm of Data Science

## BernoulliNB_vs_Multivariate
We will explore how hard it is to find the best balance between the True Positive Rate TPR and the Fasle Positive Rate FPR. We will then turn to applying multi-class classifiers over the well known MNIST digits database, and analyse the results using a confusion matrix.

## Overfitting_with_Polynomial_Regression
In this chapter we will explore two ways of dealing with overfitting.
Polynomial Regression - Model Selection
Ploynomial Regression - Regularization

## Study_on_kNNClassifier
We will get familiar with a non-parapmetric learning algorithm called k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), and will implement it. We will then analyse the bias-variance tradeoff and try to come up with the optimal kNN classifier for the given data.
For this, we will use hypothetical and artificial generated data.

## SVM_RandomForest
We will get some hands on experience with applying SVM and Random Forests algorithms for classification problems. For understanding a bit better the theoretical part of SVM, we will practice a concrete example of using a kernel to get a linear separability in a higher dimension. We will then apply a Decision Tree classsifier and random forest on the MNIST hand written digits dataset.
